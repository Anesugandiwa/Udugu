                Policy-making requires Collaborative Leadership where visionary leaders
                 working with engaged citizens produce the best possible consensus on issues 
                 in a given environment (local, national, and global). Citizens need empowerment 
                 and governments need transparency to foster mutual accountability in the formulation, 
                 implementation, and monitoring of policies. The CitizensLab platform uses both traditional 
                 and digital tools to support evidence-based dialogue, strategic policy engagement, and improved 
                 economic governance. The platform promotes a dialogue contract between citizens and those who govern 
                 by tackling prevailing information asymmetry
